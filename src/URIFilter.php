/**
 * Chainable filters for custom URI processing.
 *
 * These filters can perform custom actions on a URI filter object,
 * including transformation or blacklisting.  A filter named Foo
 * must have a corresponding configuration directive %URI.Foo,
 * unless always_load is specified to be true.
 *
 * The following contexts may be available while URIFilters are being
 * processed:
 *
 *      - EmbeddedURI: true if URI is an embedded resource that will
 *        be loaded automatically on page load
 *      - CurrentToken: a reference to the token that is currently
 *        being processed
 *      - CurrentAttr: the name of the attribute that is currently being
 *        processed
 *      - CurrentCSSProperty: the name of the CSS property that is
 *        currently being processed (if applicable)
 *
 * @warning This filter is called before scheme object validation occurs.
 *          Make sure, if you require a specific scheme object, you
 *          you check that it exists. This allows filters to convert
 *          proprietary URI schemes into regular ones.
